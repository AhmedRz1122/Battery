# Battery Animation in HTML and CSS

This project demonstrates a simple battery charging animation using HTML and CSS. The battery shape is created using basic `div` elements styled with CSS, and the charging animation simulates the filling of the battery from empty to full, accompanied by changing colors to represent different charge levels. The animation is smooth and repeats infinitely.

## Features
- Battery shape with a top lid.
- Smooth charging animation from 10% to 100%.
- Dynamic color change during the charging process (chocolate, red, chartreuse, blue, etc.).
- Fully responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
